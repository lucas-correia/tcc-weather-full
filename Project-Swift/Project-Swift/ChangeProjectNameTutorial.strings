//CHANGE PROJECT NAME TUTORIAL
//Origin: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/33370175/how-do-i-completely-rename-an-xcode-project-i-e-inclusive-of-folders
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Step 1 - Rename the project

> Click on the project you want to rename in the "Project navigator" on the left of the Xcode view.
> On the right select the "File inspector" and the name of your project should be in there under "Identity and Type", change it to the new name.
> Click "Rename" in a dropdown menu
 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Step 2 - Rename the Scheme

> In the top bar (near "Stop" button), there is a scheme for your OLD product, click on it, then go to "Manage schemes"
> Click on the OLD name in the scheme, and it will become editable, change the name
 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Step 3 - Rename the folder with your assets

> Quit Xcode
> In the correctly named master folder, there is a newly named xcodeproj file with the the wrongly named OLD folder. Rename the OLD folder to your new name
> Reopen the project, you will see a warning: "The folder OLD does not exist", dismiss the warning
> In the "Project navigator" on the left, click the top level OLD folder name
> In Utilities pane under "Identity and type" you will see the "Name" entry, change this from the OLD to the new name
> Just below there is a "Location" entry. Click on a folder with the OLD name and chose the newly renamed folder
 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Step 4 - Rename the Build plist data**

> Click on the project in the "Project navigator" on the left, in the main panel select "Build Settings"
> Search for "plist" in this section
> Under packaging, you will see Info.plist, and Product bundle identifier
> Rename the top entry in Info.plist
> Do the same for Product Identifier
 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Step 5 - Rebuild Project

> Finally, you are done and can rebuild (Command + Shift + K to clean, Command + B to build)
> (close and reopen project to see all files updated)
